///Street life\\\

###What's that?###
- It's simple text game, that resembling a Tamagotchi.
You controll a character, wich supposed to survive as a homeless, save money, buy some stuff, and as a main goal - buy a small car.

###What can it do?###
There're some simple fetures that I added:
- You can name your character (Surprise)
- Your progress will be saved, so you can continiue your play even if you close the app
- Your interactions with the game's world contains in "Actions" window.
By choosing some of them beware of sudden death, as they not just a silly buttons, the destiny of your characters is in your hands.
There're several actions, wich can give you some money, restore health and hungry, or can take it.
Any of your actions will be described by a text description on the main screen, as it text game, so you can understand what it going on.

- You can cpend your money on health potions and some weapon, but it's nessesary to save money on buying a car.
- Items that you bought in shop, wouldn't be used instantly, they will contain it your inventory until you use them.
